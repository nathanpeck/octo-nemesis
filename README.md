octo-nemesis
============

Octo Nemesis is a placeholder name for a project to learn Node.js

It will become a blogging app which can consolidate activity from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Github, and other services into one activity stream which is a window into a user's events across all their social media and online accounts.

The app is open source, allowing users to clone and host it themselves on their own server, such that they can use their own personal branded domain name to show off all their social activity in one place.
